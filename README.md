# _**Explore County Durham**_

This website was designed to allow people to explore the wonderful area that I live in. The home page features
a little bit of information about County Durham and an option for users to click a button which will take them to an interactive map. 
The map was designed with markers added of a number of attractions around the county. When the marker is clicked an ino window appears
giving the user further information about the attraction. <br>
The site also features a contact form for people to leave reviews about the places they have visitied and also request for their attraction to be
featured on the website. Their is also a reviews page to allow users to read about what people think of the attractions and hekp them choose where yto visit.

The deployed website can be viewed here  - [Explore County Durham](https://adamparker75.github.io/Explore_County_Durham/).


## _**UX**_

I created the website with a main landing page and an image of the iconic Durham cathedral. I wanted this page to 
be quite simple and let the image be the main feature. <br>
I designed the site with a mobile first approach, I wanted it to easy to navigate and created a similar structure to each page by replicating 
the header and footer across all pages. <br>
The colours for the site were chosen, as blue and yellow is the colour of the flag for County Durham.
