				<p class="review_1 reviews_text"><strong>Extraordinary Museum</strong> <br> Finally made it here, having mistakenly thought for years this was a little local history museum, and wow! Amazing and impressive French chateau style building, imposing setting, and a huge and fascinating collection.
					<br>M Griggs</p>
					<p class="review_toggle_1 reviews_text"><strong>Loved It</strong> <br> What a wonderful place, saw the Norman Cornish exhibition as well as all the art. Hilight of the day had to be the Silver swan performance. Great restaurant serving delicious food. Very friendly staff throughout. We will be back.

				<p class="review_2 reviews_text"><strong>Amazing Place</strong> <br>This is my 3rd time going to beamish and every time I go it just gets better and better, so much to see and do, I would advise you get there early so you can see most things, tearooms is lovely and food is delicious, this museum is for all ages.

					<p class="review_toggle_2 reviews_text"><strong>Fantastic Day Out</strong> <br>What a place!Well worth the 2 hour journey. Fantastic day wish we had longer. But....not enough staff in catering especially cafe in entrance.
However we would definitely go back. <br> Pete D</p>

				<p class="review_3 reviews_text"><strong>Happy Boy</strong> <br>Took my 4 year old son to Diggerland Durham. He thoroughly enjoyed it and had a fantastic time. All staff were helpful and very friendly and can't thank them enough. Totally do again in the future and recommend to anyone else.

					<p class="review_toggle_3 reviews_text"><strong>Top Spot</strong> <br>The staff really good, food basic but plentiful and at reasonable prices. The grandkids absolutely loved it , another thing is once you’ve coughed up the entry fee you
						aren’t forever reaching into your pockets again. In a nutshell a bargain and a gem, thanks for a memorable day. <br>James T</p>

				<img src="assets/images/review_images/durham_cathedral_reviews.jpg" class="reviews_image_4 img-thumbnail mx-auto d-block" alt="Beamish Museum Thumbnail">
				<p class="review_4 reviews_text"><strong>Stand in Awe</strong> <br>I have lived near Durham for many years now but never tire of popping into the cathedral just to stand in the central aisle and soak up the mastery of the masons. The columns of stone supporting the roof, each with a different pattern, are like an avenue of colossal trees stretching up to the heavens. It always takes my breath away! <br>Joe T</p>
				<p class="review_toggle_4 reviews_text"><strong>Awesome</strong> <br>Wow. You must see this if you are in area. When you walk up to place the size just hits you. When you enter a calm seems to descend upon you. Take your time have a good look around there’s lots to see. If it’s open go to top of tower, the views are terrific. <br>Paul B</p>

				<img src="assets/images/review_images/high_force_reviews.jpg" class="reviews_image_5 img-thumbnail mx-auto d-block" alt="Beamish Museum Thumbnail">
				<p class="review_5 reviews_text"><strong>Exhilarating</strong> <br>We wanted to see the Force after so much rain, and it was truly spectacular, with the spray being felt easily from the path. We were still able to climb down to the level of the water, but you have to be careful despite the handrail. It’s an easy, pretty short walk from the car park. <br>Liz M</p>
				<p class="review_toggle_5 reviews_text"><strong>Exhilarating</strong> <br>Went along to high force with friends one sunday afternoon. The car park ticket machine was out of order but we paid in the pub instead to a lovely stroll along along to see high force.
Lots of opportunities to take pictures. Definitely worth going to see! <br>Liam P</p>

				<p class="review_6 reviews_text"><strong>Excellent</strong> <br>This is an excellent place to visit. The castle was amazing and I really enjoyed the way the rooms were displayed. The volunteers were very nice and knowledgeable. The lunch was great and the staff in the café and shop were brilliant. <br>Tony B</p>
				<p class="review_toggle_6 reviews_text"><strong>Wonderful Castle</strong> <br>This is a must visit.A very interesting castle with lots to see inside.There are lots off good walks around the grounds.There are formal gardens to walk around.There is a cafe in the old stables.A tractor will give you rides around the grounds.You can easily spend the afternoon here. <br>Sue B</p>
